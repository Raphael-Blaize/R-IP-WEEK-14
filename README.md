# R-IP-WEEK-14

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.

Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

Part 2: Feature Selection

This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

Part 3: Association Rules

This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

Part 4: Anomaly Detection

You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.

Dataset

The dataset files for part 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be found below:

Part 1 and 2: [Dataset](http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset).
Part 3: [Dataset](http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII).
Part 4: [Dataset](http://bit.ly/CarreFourSalesDataset).
NB: While undertaking this independent project you won't be required to write a report due to time constraint, however, it would be good practice to ensure this is also provided as part of your deliverable.
